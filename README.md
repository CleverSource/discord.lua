# discord.lua

A Discord API library written in [Luau](https://luau.org) for use with [Lune](https://lune-org.github.io/docs).

## ⚠️ Work in Progress

This library is under active development and is **not yet production-ready**.
Breaking changes may occur at any time.

If you choose to use discord.lua in its current state, proceed with caution. Contributions and feedback are welcome as the project evolves!
